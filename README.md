# BMI_Calculator

A project created for CSE 598 Advanced Software Analysis and Design

Body Max Index Calculator is a MVC architecture-based mobile application implemented in Swift. The app uses web API calls to calculate the BMI scores and display the information to user after processing the JSON results. 

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.

BMI categories:
* Underweight = <18.5
* Normal weight = 18.5–24.9
* Overweight = 25–29.9
* Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
